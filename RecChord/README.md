this part is still oversize for guithub, so I decided to move it on the google drive, please download the source code using the link below: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17hpDGTcsZbxI5rYeTpIgR-s9BBjjicTF/view?usp=sharing

Unzip the downloaded file to get a folder called RecChord, the executable program 'RecChord.exe' is in it.
Pre-stored test images in 'test' folder can also be found in 'RecChord' folder
